# JSChallenge-pwgenerator

# Motivation
The JS Challenge was an assignment where I used what I learned from the Javascript week in the bootcamp.

# Why?
I did this project to use what I learned from the Javascript week.

# What did it solve?
The task was to create a random password generator.

# What did I learn?
Using this challenge, I learned how to use If statements and for loops. There can be multiple ways to write code that wants a certain outcome. Also, I  learned ways to write shorter code and how important it is to read documentation when writing code. Taking time to use resources outside documentation(ex. peers, coding forums, etc. ) can be useful.
